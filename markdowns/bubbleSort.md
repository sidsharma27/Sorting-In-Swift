## What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm. It is used by starting at the beginning of an array and comparing the first couple elements. The elements are only swapped if the first element has a greater value than the second element. This process of comparing adjacent elements continues throughout the array until the end has been reached & iterates again from the 0th index until the array has been sorted.
